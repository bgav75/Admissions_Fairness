\section*{Fairness In Need-Blind Admissions: A Problem of Averages}

\textit{Bryce McLaughlin, Caitlin McCarthy -- Stanford Graduate School of Business}

\medskip

{\color{red} Explain Problem, bring in anecdotes like Perez, hint at structure and results}

{\color{blue} Quotes from Books that may be useful:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Interesting Quote about Destabilization of Equilibria (Do robustness checks on solution?)} 
	\begin{quote} Because of the pandemic, many colleges have fallen short of filling their freshman class in the fall of 2020. To make up for that shortfall, they'll need to admit and enroll more students from the Class of 2021 (and maybe even in the classes beyond)
	\end{quote} (Selingo Preface)
	\item \textit{Universities use statistical models to predict acceptances}
	\begin{quote}
	the high school seniors have been admitted, tentatively, but statistical models the university uses to predict who will actually enroll indicate that too many of the record thirty thousand applications for regular decision have been accepted so far.
	\end{quote}
	(Selingo 1)
